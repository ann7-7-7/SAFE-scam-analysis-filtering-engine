# S.A.F.E. – Scam Analysis & Filtering Engine

Final Year Project  
University of Roehampton  

---

## Project Overview

S.A.F.E. (Scam Analysis & Filtering Engine) is a web-based artificial intelligence system designed to analyse suspicious digital messages (SMS, email, WhatsApp) and provide:

- Scam likelihood scores
- Explainable highlighting of risky phrases
- Human-readable safety guidance
- Privacy-first processing with no raw message storage

The project focuses on combining NLP-based scam detection with explainable AI and GDPR-aligned system design.

## Midpoint Review Status

This repository provides evidence for the midpoint assessment including:

- Literature-driven requirements specification
- Personas, user stories, and user journeys
- Wireframes and user flow diagrams
- System architecture and UML models
- Deployment design
- Ethics and risk planning
- Project management artefacts
- Early proof-of-concept planning

## Repository Structure


docs/       -> Report drafts and design write-ups  
diagrams/   -> Wireframes, UML, deployment and architecture diagrams  
appendix/   -> Ethics form, risk register, Kanban screenshots, supervisor evidence  
prototype/  -> Proof-of-concept code and implementation notes

## Proof of Concept

The proof-of-concept implementation will demonstrate:

- Message submission via API
- Preprocessing pipeline
- Baseline ML classifier
- Transformer-based model prototype
- Explainability layer
- Risk scoring
- Privacy-preserving telemetry

Progress and screenshots will be added to `/appendix/proof-of-concept/`.

## Project Management

Task tracking and sprint planning are maintained using:

- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Projects (Kanban board)
- Commit history

Screenshots of planning boards and sprint activity are stored in:



/appendix/project-management/

## Ethics and Compliance

Ethical approval will be sought via the University of Roehampton ethics process.

Materials including:

- Ethics application PDF
- Participant information sheet
- Consent form
- Data handling plan

are stored in:

# S.A.F.E. – Proof of Concept Prototype

This folder contains the early-stage proof-of-concept implementation for the S.A.F.E. (Scam Analysis & Filtering Engine) system.

The prototype demonstrates:

- End-to-end message submission
- Text preprocessing
- Scam classification model stub
- Explainability placeholder
- Privacy-preserving handling (no raw message storage)
- API-based architecture

At midpoint stage, the focus is on demonstrating technical feasibility rather than production readiness.

---

## Planned Prototype Features

- REST API endpoint for message submission
- Text preprocessing pipeline
- Baseline ML classifier
- Transformer-based classifier (DistilBERT)
- Explainability output (LIME/SHAP)
- Risk score computation
- Safety guidance templates
- Latency logging (no raw messages)

---

## Intended Technology Stack

- Python
- Flask or FastAPI
- scikit-learn
- HuggingFace Transformers
- LIME / SHAP
- Pandas / NumPy

---

## Current Status (Midpoint Review)

- Repository created 
- Architecture defined 
- UML and deployment diagrams added 
- Requirements documented 
- Ethics plan drafted 
- Risk register completed 

### Next Implementation Steps

1. Create Flask/FastAPI app skeleton
2. Add `/analyse` API route
3. Implement text preprocessing
4. Load baseline classifier
5. Return dummy risk score (initial POC)
6. Add UI form
7. Run local tests
8. Capture screenshots for Appendix G

## How to Run (Placeholder)

Instructions will be added once prototype code is implemented.

## Evidence for Assessment

Screenshots and logs from prototype execution will be saved in:

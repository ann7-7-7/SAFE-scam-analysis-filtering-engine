- Scam likelihood scores
- Explainable highlighting of risky phrases
- Human-readable safety guidance
- Privacy-first processing with no raw message storage

This repository contains design artefacts, documentation, ethics materials, project planning evidence, and the early proof-of-concept structure for the system.
